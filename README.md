This file is inspired by the water piece,which is "Steal a moon on the water with a bucket.Keep stealing until no moon is seen onthe water." I created a small fish that follows the mouse movement and always faces the center of the moon. Each time the fish touches the moon, it changes color and grows slightly larger. Meanwhile, the moon gradually diminishes in size and brightness, but will never completely disappear, leaving a faint shadow in the water. This concept reflects my understanding of water piece, draining the moon just likes a romantic expression of eternity, and I hope my code could captures this interpretation.
